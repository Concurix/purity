.Urgent

.Sometime
- Somehow store guard *expressions* in the lookup table, so that guards
  like `when lists:all(fun pure/1, L)` can be resolved.

.Maybe
- Make error handling pure, by passing errors/warnings around in the
  state record

- Add plt option to keep only certain applications in the PLT. This
  would provide more refined results, while making subsequent runs
  faster, given that only the kept subset is of interest to the user.
