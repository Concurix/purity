Purity
======
Michael Pitidis <mpitid@gmail.com>

Purity is a static analyzer which determines the purity of Erlang
functions. It can be used as a standalone application or as part of
other applications, through a simple API.

Installation
------------
After retrieving a copy of the source code with

---------------
git clone git://github.com/mpitid/purity.git
---------------

change into the `purity` directory and run `make` to build the code.

Currently there is no mechanism for automated installation, so you will
have to do the following manually:

Add the directory to the `ERL_LIBS` environment variable. Assuming you
cloned the code to your home directory, something like the following
will suffice:

--------------------------------
export ERL_LIBS="$HOME/purity"
--------------------------------

Bash users may place this directive in their `$HOME/.bashrc` file, so
that it's executed upon login.

You also need to place a copy of the `purity` script in the toplevel
directory to some other directory in your `PATH`, for instance
`/usr/local/bin`. Alternatively you can add the cloned directory to the
`PATH` environment variable as well, with

--------------------------------
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/purity"
--------------------------------

To sum up, these are the complete instructions for a user of the bash
shell:

--------------------------------
git clone git://github.com/mpitid/purity.git
cd purity
make
echo ERL_LIBS="`pwd`" >> $HOME/.bashrc
echo PATH=\$PATH:`pwd` >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
--------------------------------

Purity has only been tested on Debian GNU/Linux so far.
